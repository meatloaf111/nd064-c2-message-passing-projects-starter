Architectural Decisions
-------------------------------
I applied following message passing techniques in this architecture.:
- REST APIs
- Message Queues (Kafka)
- gRPC

The frontend client leverages REST APIs to enable integration with the various HTTP routes.
REST was chosen because it is the most straightforward form of message passing that does not introduce unnecessary complexity into our solution.
There are no requirements which require high-performance integration which requires another techniques.

On the other hand, I expect large volume of transaction of location data from mobile devices.
In order to have better peformance , I chose gRPC.
This will lead to handle a large volume of location data that will sent from many mobile devices.

Location data is then writen into Kafka topic.
I chose message queues because to achieve improved performance, improved reliability.
This will lead to have a relaiable architecture without losing any of location data coming from numerous mobile debices.
