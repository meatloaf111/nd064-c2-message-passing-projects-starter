gRPC Documentation
-------------------------
The location data should conform to the following protobuf definition:

'''
message LocationMessage {
    int32 person_id = 1;
    string latitude = 2;
    string longitude = 3;
}
'''

For example, here is a sample payload:

'''
{
    "person_id": 1,
    "latitude": "26.212",
    "longitude": "127.681"
}
'''

The gRPC server is hosted by the 'udaconnect-location-ingest' service.

To test, I used Postman because it is simple. Also you don't have to develop and maintain test client code.

'''
Send request to grpc://localhost:30005

with message body:
{
    "person_id": 1,
    "latitude": "26.212",
    "longitude": "127.681"
}
